<p>The average utility bill for a 2-Bedroom apartment is 19460. Masuzi 3 years ago No Comments. Not surprisingly utilities are going to be cheaper in a space that has smaller square footage like a studio or 1-bedroom than a larger space. The average utility bill for a 1-Bedroom apartment is 12501. Thats larger than a studio but still within the 010 per square foot rate range. Pin On Technology.</p>
