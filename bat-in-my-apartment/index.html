<p>So my apartment complex had a bat infestation tonight. A bat flew into my apartment and has spent the last five minutes cluelessly circling my living room ceiling lamp. I closed my door and I dont know who to call or. I did not handle it well. It follows me outside and is trying to find a way out.
