<p>So its not your landlords choice its your citys or states to determine the legality. There are no restrictions for reptiles or primates but you may not keep any non-domesticated felines skunks wolves or bears as pets. For example I just looked up Bearded Dragon Facts and found this cool item. What Property Managers Say. Landlords have the right to set restrictions in their rental properties.

<p>This group of pets are the fastest growing part of the pet industry world wide and are increasing in popularity every year. I agree its insanity. I assume that if the animal can be bought in a petstore it is a domesticated animal as opposed to poultry etc. However whether or not its an actual law on the books apartment complexes often can write pretty much what they want in their lease as far as a pet policy check your own lease for your pet policy. Whether you should keep a pet is personal choice regardless of the animal be it cat dog or a snake.
