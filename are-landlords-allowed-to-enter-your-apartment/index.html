<p>Theres nothing wrong with agreeing to a landlords request to inspect for needed repairs. If there is an emergency if you are present and allow the landlord to enter at any given time or if you have abandoned the property your landlord may enter the premises without giving proper. 3 For example if a burst pipe in your apartment is leaking into the unit downstairs your landlord may enter or send someone from the maintenance crew to enter your home if youre not there. Advance notice is usually required before a landlord can enter the tenants apartment. The landlord can enter the apartment at any hour of the day as long as the landlord and tenant both agree to this time.
