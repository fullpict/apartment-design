<p>The general rule is that you can of course paint your own apartment I doubt that anyone has a lease that says he cannot or you can have your landlord paint it lanflord-white ever 3 years if you choose. Unfortunately most landlords wont allow it. If the answer is no you could ask for permission to do the painting yourself. Before you take it upon yourself to do it ask your landlord if hes willing to let you paint your cabinets. Im not trying to scare you but you should be aware so that you can be careful to avoid that situation.
