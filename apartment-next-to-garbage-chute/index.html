<p>They are safer and more sanitary than other options. My unit is close to the garbage chute. The trash chute rooms are always a mess not just because people leave their garbage on the floor but management never monitors the chute rooms or cleans them up. To help minimize the possibility of fire and smoke spreading through a trash chute chutes are required to comply with National Fire Protection Association NFPA regulations. A garbage chute also known as trash chute is a huge 24 to 36-diameter tube that runs down the height of a high-rise building through which trash is moved to a central point on the ground floor.

<p>Other noises that you may notice are the constant opening and closing of the entrance door into the chute vestibule and the clanking of recyclables that are thrown into the bins that are also stored near the garbage chute. And of course theres no one on the. To help minimize the possibility of fire and smoke spreading through a trash chute chutes are required to comply with National Fire Protection Association NFPA regulations. Residents today consider convenient garbage disposal an important criterion for picking an apartment which is why all contractors and builders are switching to apartment chutes. I agree with others that noise odors and overall foot-traffic near your unit especially in the age of COVID would be some issues that would worry me in terms of an actual purchase.

<p>Like an elevator shaft garbage chutes can create a chimney effect for the spread of fire and smoke throughout the building especially if the chute is not protected by a fire-rated assembly. Odors can come from two different sources dirty trash chutes and odorous air rising up the chute from the collection room where smelly trash sits between garbage pick-ups. Taking the garbage all the way from your apartment to designated garbage dumping area of your building is time consuming. FWIW it was originally built as a condo and then down converted to an apartment and I would not recommend it particularly if you are in the unit in the floor above the dumpster. I lived in an apartment next to the trash chute.
