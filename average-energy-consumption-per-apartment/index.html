<p><strong>Average Energy Consumption Per Apartment</strong>, Figure 3 shows average energy consumption per square foot steadily declining by year built. Heat energy consumption in apartment buildings was determined on the basis of factual consumption in 1999. So you can expect your 2 bedroom apartment to use anywhere between 1000 1500 kWh a day.</p>

<h3 id="that-said-the-cost-of-utilities">That said the cost of utilities.</h3><p>These estimates calculate that for a 1 or 2-bedroom house average gas consumption currently stands at around 8000kWh with electricity consumption approximately 2000kW. 1 However electricity use in homes varies across regions of the United States and across housing types. For the average condo that is about 1310 ft 2 in size we estimate average annual consumption to be about 7008 kWh electricity per year. The average specific heat energy consumption in the investigated 113 residential buildings was 223 kWhm2 per average year. However bill-payers aged 40-49 reported the highest average bills in the Melbourne area at 1097. So there you have it.</p>
