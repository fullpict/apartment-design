<p>It is common in the US to space ceiling joists 16 on center yet in some cases they are laid out 24 on Center and in other circumstances 48 on center. Once youve located the first one the others are easier to find. If you only need to know which direction the joists run access the attic and take a look. Ceiling joists can fulfill an aesthetic element for your house on top of being an integral part to the integrity of your build. Ceiling joists support whatever is directly above them.

<p>Roof trusses are triangular forms used in construction of sloped roofs and basically consist of rafters and ceiling joists pre-constructed as a unit. Each individual ceiling joist is placed in between opposing walls and attached to the tops of each wall with a wall plate. Exposed joists are ceiling structural members that are made visible by removing the ceiling drywall or plaster. If you hit a joist continue measuring in 16 inch increments until youre at a desired location. Ceiling joists of the first floor of a two-story structure often serve as floor joists for the second floor.

<p>A ceiling joist is a horizontal member that spans across your ceiling used in framing to span an open space. The building is in central Copenhagen and was built in the 1850s so I cant assume that the joists are spaced 16 or 24 apart. Exposed joists are different. Ceiling joists are a critical element of a houses structure. Spans for joists greater than 20 feet that are parallel to the rafters require a 12-inch joist spacing when using 2-inch by 10-inch 2 Douglas and hemlock fir or southern pine or 16-inch spacing when using 2-inch by 10-inch 2.
