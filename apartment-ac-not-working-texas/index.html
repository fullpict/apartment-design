<p>I am going to take you through some of the common ways that your AC unit can malfunction and whether or not you should try to fix it yourself or have a professional repairman or your maintenance guy come out and take a look at it. Repair and deduct tenants have the right to make the necessary repairs themselves and take the cost out of their next monthly rent payment provided that the total cost of repairs do not exceed the amount of one months. More than likely your AC could have a problem that has an easy fix such as a dirty or clogged filter or vents that are not allowing proper airflow in the apartment. If you know a lawyer he could write a letter to the management company and set up an escrow account where you would deposit your rent till the AC is really fixed. In the meantime check the filter which is probably not an issue if you can feel the air coming out check the evaporator coils inside to see if theyre frozen which is probably not an issue if air is moving through them and the breakers to see if theyre flipped otherwise turn them off.

<p>You must provide written notice in writing to your landlord to correct the problem. I have a hard time believing the people in high rise penthouse apartments have to suffer like this. Non-working units must be reported and fixed before the tenant moves into the apartment. The AC pipes outside were freezing up so I had them come recharge the AC and that stopped the freezing of the pipes. My problems is that it takes forever for the apt to cool.

<p>Renters should test the system prior to moving in and signing the lease. If it isnt freezing outside then it isnt considered an emergency. The AC pipes outside were freezing up so I had them come recharge the AC and that stopped the freezing of the pipes. You must provide written notice in writing to your landlord to correct the problem. If an air conditioner breaks a tenant is supposed to notify the landlord in writing that the AC is out. 2818 Place Texas A M University Student Apartments Student Apartment College Place Texas A M University.</p>
